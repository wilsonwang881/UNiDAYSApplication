## Link to the program specification: 

https://github.com/MyUNiDAYS/tech-placements-19-20

## Description:

The web interface includes two parts: one for selecting goods and adding them to the shopping cart, the other part for adding new goods and setting the prices and and discounts. Just click on the buttons on the left pane to switch. Note that once the prices, discounts or list of goods is changed, the shopping cart will be emptied and the user needs to re-select the goods.

## Implementation:

The application is implemented mainly using JavaScript and can be considered to be server-less. I am currently trying to integrate with Vue.js for better performance.


## Deployment:

Put the code into an online static website hosting service. Possible choices include but not limited to Amazon Web Services S3, GitHub repository web hosting (need to change the repository's settings) and Google Drive web hosting. Note some of the services are free of charge but some may incur additional charges.
